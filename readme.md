## Version Alpha 1.0; August, 2017

The Chesapeake Spokes Bicycle Club Membership Roster was maintained in a Google spreadsheet for many years, but the changing needs of the club required more robust capabilities.
The new version is based in Laravel 5.4, and uses a repository pattern to better integrate the Model code with the database structure.
